# Crypto-Portfolio-App

The Crypto Portfolio App is a decentralized application (DApp) built using React.js and ether.js, designed to manage your cryptocurrency tokens effectively. The app allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet, add tokens, transfer tokens, check token allowances, and view historical token price data. The backend functionality interacts with the Ethereum blockchain using the Ethereum.io API to fetch token information and validate transactions.
